# DualSense Motion Controller Mapper

This project is a Python-based application that allows you to capture and map motion data from a Sony DualSense controller to custom actions. You can save specific controller orientations and create complex motion sequences, which can then be bound to keyboard presses or mouse clicks. This is useful for creating custom controls for games, applications, or accessibility tools.

## Features

* **Real-time Data Display**: View live gyroscope and accelerometer data from your DualSense controller.
* **Position Saving**: Record and save specific controller orientations as "positions."
* **Motion Sequences**: Chain saved positions together to create complex motion gestures.
* **Action Binding**: Bind completed motion sequences to keyboard keys or mouse clicks.
* **Configuration Management**: Export and import your saved positions and motion sequences to a `.cfg` file.
* **Customizable Smoothing and Padding**: Fine-tune the sensitivity of motion detection.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* A Sony DualSense Controller
* A Bluetooth-enabled PC

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nicholast833/PyDualSense-MotionToKey.git
    cd PyDualSense-MotionToKey
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install pynput pydualsense
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Connect your DualSense Controller** to your computer via Bluetooth or cable.
2.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python main_app.py
    ```

## How to Use

* **Saving a Position**: Hold your controller in the desired position and click the "Save Current Position (Multi-Point)" button.
* **Creating a Motion Sequence**:
    1.  Go to the "Motions" tab and click "Create New Motion Sequence."
    2.  Give the sequence a name.
    3.  Click the "Edit Positions" button to add saved positions to the sequence.
* **Binding an Action**: Select a motion sequence and enter a key (e.g., `w`, `space`, `ctrl`) or mouse click (`left_click`, `right_click`) in the "Action Binding" field.
